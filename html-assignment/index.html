    <h2>About me</h2>
    <h3>
      <abbr title=About-me-1 >A-M-1</abbr>
    </h3>
    <p>I was diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder called Fredreichs ataxia (FA) a few months after my 9th birthday. I had little understanding at the time of the severity of the diagnosis and I felt I was tough enough to take whatever was thrown at me. When I was 11 it started clearly affecting my balance and falling was becoming more commonplace in day-to-day life. When I was 14, I was in high school and it had progressed to the point where I was falling painfully multiple times a day but I still rejected a wheelchair because I felt the importance of fighting FA, even though the school was requesting I do. A year later I was 15 and in grade 10 covid hit I lived with my grandparents and my grandpa was terminally ill, so my family took covid and quarantine very seriously. A few months into quarantine I was losing the ability to walk at all and started to use a wheelchair full-time, overall, I was in quarantine for 15 months, so I decided to go back to school for my senior year. It was terrifying to see everyone I grew up with as I was using a wheelchair full-time now (even though everyone knew about my disease already and didn’t care). It was actually not a big deal at all, I learned that your limitations, insecurities, and challenges are self-imposed and can be conquered with courage.</p>
