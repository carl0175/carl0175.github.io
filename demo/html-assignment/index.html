    <h1>Kaelan Carlson</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I’m Kaelan Carlson from the Ottawa valley in the west Carlton district. I grew up in a small town pretty rurally but my high school also bussed in about 35-40% of the students from Kanata and the city, that had a bit significance as there was kind of the lingering’s of a rivalry between the “city kid’s” and the “hick’s”. though I didn’t really care much and was well known and liked among both groups I identified myself as a “hick” and most of my go to friend’s were considered hick’s.
